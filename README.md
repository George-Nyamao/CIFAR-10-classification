# CIFAR-10-classification

## Description
This was done as a project to showcase the knowledge gained after nine weeks of intense training. I chose CIFAR-10 because it gave me an opportunity to work with and increase my knowledge in Deep Learning and CNN in particular.

I used CNNs to build the neural network and added MaxPooling, Dropout, and Dense layers. 

After training the model and obtained an optimum accuracy, I deployed the model on a Docker container before exposing it throw Google Cloud Platform.
